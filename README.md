# Hello! A little about myself.
I'm Jared, and I'm a learning programmer. FOSS and VR are my big interests, but I like to learn whatever I might find useful. My goal is to create tools for making Godot games in VR with an emphasis on multiplayer. As of right now, I know mostly C# and GDScript, with bits of C++.
